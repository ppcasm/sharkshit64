# SharkShit64 Firmware (for ESP32 based clone)



This is the firmware used to work together with Rick Weiss's SharkShit64 open source ESP32 based Interact Sharkwire Online clone.

### Usage



This is all currently a WIP, but does include some basic functionality.



Once you flash the file to your SharkShit64 cart you will want to set up your WiFi credentials by getting on a WiFi capable device (PC, or phone, for example) and connecting to the SSID "SharkShit64" and in your web browser on the connected device you'll want to go to http://192.168.4.1 at which point you should be greeted with an SSID and PASS field that you use to fill in your internet connected router WiFi credentials.



After this is done, you should boot into an activation page. You can use any credentials to sign into this page, and once connected, you should get a screen telling you that you have completed activation and to restart.



When the system restarts you'll then be able to add a new user by selecting one of the "Add new user" buttons.



You'll then be asked to select a username and password, and once you do that and select "Add to account" you'll then be asked to restart again, and upon rebooting, you'll then see options for email, go online, and a few other options to change settings. At this point you can test going online by selecting the option from the menu.
